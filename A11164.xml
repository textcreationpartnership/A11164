            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> hauing already ſong the mercy of GOD toward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he will ſing alſo the iudgement of God toward his enemies.

               <pb facs="tcp:12416:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we read the ruine of them both. For <hi>Chuſh</hi> trauailed with miſchiefe, and brought forth a lye: he made a pit, and digged it,<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.1.15.16.</note> and fell into it himſelfe, his miſchiefe returned vpon his own head &amp; his crueltie fel vpon his owne pate. And after that <hi>Doeg</hi> had for a ſpace boaſted himſelf in his wickednes, that being a man of power, he could doe miſchiefe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 52.1.5.</note> at the length God pluckt him out of his tabernacle, and roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him out of the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.

            <p>Now the good that may enſue by the conſideration of the fall of Gods and the Churches enemies, is of two ſorts.

And in the deſtruction of the Babilonians, the earth was filled with the knowledge of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Lord,<note place="margin">Hab. 2.14.</note> as the waters couer the Sea. Secondly, men, (if they haue grace) may be thereby edified, according to the confeſſion of the faithfull in <hi>Iſai</hi> ſaying:<note place="margin">Iſay. 26.9.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Hitherto <hi>Dauid</hi> hath ſung <hi>mercie and iudgement,</hi> in reſpect of the time paſt by way of praiſe and thankſgiuing. Now he proceedeth to ſing the ſame ſong in regard of the time to come, touching the adminiſtration of his kingdome by way of practiſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>the dutie of princes and publike Magiſtrates,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 13.3. 1. Pet. 2.14.</note> 
               <hi>is, to be the miniſters of God for the wealth of them that doe well by the exerciſe of godlineſſe and honeſtie, and to take vengeance on them that doe euill committing impietie and iniquitie.</hi> And theſe two, <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>iudgement,</hi> muſt goe hand in hand, being in aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion combined together, leaſt if they were altogether, and vtterly ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, then mercy without iudgement might turne into fooliſh pittie, and iudgement without any temper of mercie might become extreame cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12416:11"/>And firſt to ſpeake of <hi>Mercie,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie is that Prince who hath the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the will to be mercifull to whom, and when, and where it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient.<note place="margin">Pro. 20.28.

               <hi>but in the light of his countenance is life, and his fauour is as a cloud of the latter raine, and like the dew vpon the graſſe.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> well knowing how laudable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable it was to be mercifull with diſcretion, being eſtabliſhed in his kingdome,<note place="margin">2.

mercie of God (that is, ſuch mercie as is acceptable to God) for his old deare friend <hi>Ionathans</hi> ſake. And we find it to be a laudable cuſtome of princes at their firſt entrance into their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to ſhew mercie at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in this wiſe, that I may ſpeake in the ſcripture phraſe in the Pſalmes, by hearing the mourning of the priſoner,<note place="margin">Pſal. 102.20</note> and deliuering the children of death.

            <p>Howbeit, though crueltie is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be abhorred, yet remiſſnes in dealing with the aduerſaries of the truth, the practiſers and maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of a falſe worſhip, is likewiſe to bee excluded, becauſe it is moſt perilous to the Church of God, as appeareth by the hiſtory of the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites, who by the conniuency of the

Whereupon raſhly without leauing the one eare for the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, he gaue ſentence, condemning the innocent in fauour of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe, being a calumniator; ſaying to <hi>Ziba,</hi> behold thine are all that pertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> And when as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> afterward met <hi>Dauid</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning victoriouſly after the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and fully cleared himſelfe of the haynous crime of treaſon wherewith he had beene falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged, then <hi>Dauid</hi> giueth ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in this wiſe,<note place="margin">2.

them. And here we may obſerue, that in the caſe of iuſtice our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is more vpright then our <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation is ſounder then our prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. Or to ſpeake to the capacitie of the meaneſt hearer, a man may more eaſily, penne the cauſe of Iuſtice in his priuate ſtudie, then rightly prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it in publike vpon the bench. For in ſolitarie meditation, a man may without difficultie abandon all raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and partiall affection, but in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall place abroad, reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and other corruptions do eaſily enter into our mindes and hearts, by the miniſterie of our eyes and eares.</p>
            <p>Now the way to preuent this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, is to doe that ſincerely, which <hi>Dauid</hi> promiſeth heere to doe; namely, <hi>to ſing vnto the Lord,</hi> that is to ſhew <hi>mercie,</hi> and practiſe <hi>Iudgement</hi> to the glory of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all things ought to be referred,
<pb facs="tcp:12416:18"/>
according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> direction, <hi>whether ye eate, drinke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.31.</note> 
               <hi>or whatſoeuer ye doe, do all to the glorie of God.</hi> Inſomuch as almes muſt be giuen in charitie without the ſound of a trumpet:<note place="margin">Mat. 6.1. to the 7.</note> and prayer muſt be made of deuotion without publike oſtentation. And to deſcend from the generall doctrine to the particular inſtruction which I haue in hand, miſerable was the caſe of that wretched Iudge who did right to the poore widow,<note place="margin">Luke. 18.4.5.</note> not for feare of God, or reuerence to man, but onely to auoid her clamor and importunity. And no better was the caſe of the-Philiſtins in the booke of the Iudges, who when as the Timnite gaue his daughter being <hi>Samſons</hi> wife,<note place="margin">Iudg. 15.1. to the 7.</note> to an other man, they regarded not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this vniuſt and adulterous act: But when as <hi>Samſon</hi> in reuenge of this wrong, had with three hundred Foxes turned taile to tayle, hauing
<pb facs="tcp:12416:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firebands faſtened thereto, ſet on fire, and burned vp the rickes and the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding corne with the vineyards and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues of the Philiſtins: then they came vp in troupes and burnt the Timnite and his daughter with fire. Thus the wicked puniſh not vice for loue of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but to be reuenged in reſpect of former loſſe, and for feare of future daunger which elſe might come vnto them.</p>
            <p>Againe, <hi>to thee O Lord will I ſing;</hi> that is, howſoeuer by the chaunting of this dittie of <hi>mercie and iudgement,</hi> I ſhall ſeeme to howle in the eares of the vngodly, yet my ſong to thee O lord, ſhal be thought very melodious. Whereby we are taught this generall doctrine, that in doing of our dutie in our ſeuerall vocations, this ought to be our comfort, that our words and works are pleaſing vnto God, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they be diſpleaſing to the world

So though <hi>Noe</hi> was ſcorned by the men of his time, for preparing the Arke, and vrging repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to preuent the perill of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge to come: yet is he by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, <hi>ad perpetuam rei memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> chronicled for a preacher of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes.
